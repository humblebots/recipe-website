    1. Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened.  Stir in garlic and sauté for 1-2 more minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant.
    2. Add in the vegetable stock, carrots, celery, potatoes, tomatoes and green chiles, roasted red peppers, beans, cabbage, cumin, crushed red pepper flakes, and stir to combine.  Continue cooking until the soup reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 20-30 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.
    3. Stir in the greens until combined.  Then taste and season the soup with salt and pepper as needed.
    4. Serve warm, garnished with toppings if desired.
