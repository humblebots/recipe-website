  ingredients_markdown: |-

    * 1 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
    * 3 cups powdered sugar (360 grams)
    * 2 - 4 tablespoons heavy cream
    * 1 teaspoon vanilla 
    * Pinch of salt

    1. Beat the butter until smooth in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large mixing bowl with a hand electric mixer.
    2. Add the powdered sugar and mix on low speed then increase to medium and continue mixing for a minute or two until the mixture comes together.
    3. Add the heavy cream, starting with 2 tablespoons. I usually add a 3rd or 4th tablespoon of heavy cream to take away some of the powdered sugar flavor and give it a more rich flavor. Also add the vanilla and the salt and mix on medium - high for another minute or two until everything is well combined.
    4. Put into a piping bag for cupcakes or use it to frost a cake!

This 5 ingredient buttercream frosting always comes out so rich and flavorful and it's so much better than the frosting you can buy at the store. I have used it several times with boxed cake mix (I know, I need to try making my own!) to whip up a quick batch of cupcakes.
