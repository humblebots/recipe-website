# Robyn's Recipe Website

## Setup

1. Add your site and author details in `_config.yml`.
2. Add your Google Analytics, Disqus and MailChimp keys to `_config.yml`.
3. Add your details to `_data/sidebar.yml`
4. Get a workflow going to see your site's output (with [CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/) or Jekyll locally).

## Develop

Treat was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.4.3, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
